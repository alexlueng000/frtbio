      "intro": "A serum-free medium applicable to a wide range of animal cell lines (tumor and conventional). Cells preserved with this medium can be stored long-term at −80 °C (>5 years). The formulation is chemically defined, free of animal-derived proteins and serum, minimizing contamination by bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma to ensure biosafety. It contains DMSO, glucose, and other nutrients to improve post-thaw viability and vigor, and is also suitable for serum-free cultured cells and protein-expression cells."
